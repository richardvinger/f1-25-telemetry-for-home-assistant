# F1 25 Game Telemetry for Home Assistant

A high-performance custom integration for Home Assistant that brings real-time telemetry from EA Sports' **F1 25** game directly into your smarthome.

## 💡 What is this for?

- **🏮 Immersive Lighting**: Trigger your smart lights to match the flags! Flash yellow for yellow flags, red for session stops, or perhaps turn off all the lights when there's terminal damage.
- **🖥️ Ultimate Race Dashboards**: Create real-time dashboards that are useful during the race, with information like tyre wear, temperatures, and lap times.
- **🏁 Historic Data Analysis**: Track your performance over time. View graphs of your lap times, fuel consumption, and tyre degradation across different sessions.

## ✨ Features

- **🏎️ Real-time Car Telemetry**: Speed, RPM, Gear, Fuel levels, and ERS deployment.
- **🚦 Race Control**: Track session types (P, Q, R), session status, and start lights.
- **🛠️ Detailed Damage Tracking**: Individual wear and damage sensors for all four tyres, wings, and floor.
- **⏱️ Lap Timing**: Live lap counting, position tracking, and a formatted "Last Lap" time sensor.
- **☁️ Weather Forecast**: Forecast parsing to help you plan your pit strategy.
- **➡️ UDP Forwarding**: Re-transmit raw telemetry packets to another IP/Port, which can be useful if you have an existing dashboard on a phone or steering wheel.
